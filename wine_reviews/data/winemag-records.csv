Italy,"You'll need to swirl the glass a few times to release the enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, Alpine herb and an intriguing smoky note. The savory vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering layers of crunchy green apple, zesty tangerine and juicy yellow peach set against crisp acidity. A flinty mineral note graces the lingering finish, lending even more depth.

US,"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage.

US,"This blend of Quinta del Mar and Drum Canyon vineyards makes for a very powerful and attention-demanding wine. Sultry aromas of roasted red cherry and caramelized berry meet with well-integrated clove and allspice on the potent nose.

France,"The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age. It is balanced, concentrated and touched by spice and toastiness from the wood aging. In tandem with that are generous fruits within a dense structure that is just beginning to smooth out. Drink from 2018–2038.",Château Bouscassé,95,Southwest France,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Alain Brumont 2010 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),Red Blend,Alain Brumont
France,"A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever.

France,"Regarded almost as a Grand Cru in its own right, the Moutonne vineyard, wholly owned by Albert Bichot, is in a corner of the Vaudésir Grand Cru vineyard. In this sumptuous year, the wine is more generous, ripe yellow fruits than mineral texture. The acidity and the tangy aftertaste are a reminder that this is from cool-climate Chablis.

Firmly structured but loaded with finesse, the palate delivers ripe Marasca cherry, crushed black raspberry, vanilla, savory mineral and thyme alongside fine-grained tannins.

Argentina,"Inky berry and smoky, minerally aromas of charcoal properly introduce a saturated palate with tons of oak but even more fruit at its base. This supercharged Malbec is almost over the top, with massive blackberry, chocolate and molasses flavors. Burnt toast and chocolate mint-chip flavors on the finish confirm that this is a monster red.

Ripe, round and lush on the nose, with full-force blackberry and prune aromas, this shows titanic grip, depth and ripeness on the palate.

Combined, the structure and the fruit make an imposing, potentially long-lived wine.",Pape,95,Dão,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Alvaro Castro 2007 Pape Red (Dão),Portuguese Red,Alvaro Castro
Portugal,"Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol— thanks to the Dão's mountain climate and granite soil. Pape is a top wine from Alvaro Castro made predominantly from Touriga Nacional.

Spain,"One of the world's best PX wines is Solera 1927, the pride of Alvear. Whatever solera stocks went into this bottling were well selected. Aromas of maple and fine wood turn to fig and caramel. Saturation and weight on the palate are expected, but this has some (though not a lot) acidic cut. Deep flavors of fig and Nutella finish with nuttiness and warmth.

Austria,"The scent of very ripe Amalfi lemon hovers above everything but the second sniff immediately signals juicy Mirabelle plums edged with Golden Delicious apple. The palate is equally ripe and smooth—warm sunshine refracted through a prism of opulent fruit, yet toned and precise. Some exposure to air reveals a distinctly stony minerality. A keeper.",Steinertal Smaragd,95,Wachau,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Alzinger 2013 Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,Alzinger
Austria,"The nose is closed, but the palate speaks of concentration and a stony core that is still tightly coiled. Once this is ready, it will unfurl into glorious lemon zest and oil notions. For now, this is taut and tight, secretive and closed. There is an implicit stony slenderness, which has a heart of generous fruit buried at its core. This comes with a great promise of future glory, immense direction and concentration.

US,"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",Champoux Vineyard Red Wine,95,Washington,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),Red Blend,Andrew Will
US,"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine,96,Washington,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),Red Blend,Andrew Will
US,"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",Sorella Red Wine,96,Washington,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),Red Blend,Andrew Will

France,"The 2009 Les Cailloux is a classically built Châteauneuf that should age well through at least 2025. The blend of 65% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 3% Cinsault starts off with lovely notes of wild thyme and dark fruit, then adds herbal complexity and chocolaty richness. It's full bodied yet firm, with some dusty but elegant tannins on the finish.

Italy,"Fast becoming one of the world's top luxury cuvées, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah is a complex amalgam of dry, classy fruit, herbal notes, smoked meat, black pepper and baking spices. Its calling card is its perfect body weight. It isn't heavy or jammy, but it manages to offer tons of stuffing and a graceful finish loaded with the essences of cola, coffee and chocolate. If possible, it should be cellared for several more years.",Guado Al Tasso,95,Tuscany,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Antinori 1999 Guado Al Tasso  (Bolgheri),Red Blend,Antinori
Austria,"Earthiness, undergrowth and juicy wild strawberries tinged with wet oak leaf dominate the nose and palate of this exemplary wine.

Austria,"The most gentle strawberry fruit appears unobtrusively on the nose. The palate reveals incredibly pure and honest wild strawberry fruit. The palate is slender but totally concentrated—there is depth to the wine and something ethereal and utterly seductive. This is not about power but about arresting allure.

This is honest and all the more disarming for that.",Reserve Limited Edition,95,Wagram,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Anton Bauer 2014 Reserve Limited Edition Pinot Noir (Wagram),Pinot Noir,Anton Bauer
US,"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases.

Spain,"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character.

Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging.

France,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts.

The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish.

The honeyed notes become more effusive with air, edging towards honeycomb and butter shortbread. Despite this richness which also illuminates the palate, the body of this vintage crémant—which was on its lees in magnum for more than a decade—remains slender, chalky and totally pure.

Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,Barca-Velha,100,Douro,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha

US,"Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins.

US,"This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth.",Cailloux Vineyard,97,Washington,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Cayuse 2008 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Syrah,Cayuse

US,"The Frog is a bit reductive, a bit shy in 2009 and needs extra decanting. With proper breathing time, it shows inviting notes of violets and strawberries, and it gains concentration through the midpalate, with additions of cherry and an almost liquid minerality.

US,"In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again.

France,"Widely regarded as the most majestic of the Chablis Grand Crus, Les Clos has produced a properly impressive and richly dense wine.

France,"From vines inside the Les Clos Grand Cru purchased in 1904 from the Hospices de Chablis, this is a richly structured wine. It's dense with layers of flavor and great aging potential.

US,"This is the best Pinot Noir yet from the Drouhin estate; immensely concentrated and rich. The fruit is complex and penetrating, focused and long, layered throughout a generous and extended finish.

US,"This reserve-level Pinot from DDO is exceptional in every way. Silky, elegant and deeply-fruited, it marries a plush midpalate of red berries and cherries to compelling grace notes of pine needle, cola and mocha.

US,"A block selection, this most rare offering from DDO has rippingly good aromatics, intense and complex, with dusty, dreamy spices wrapped around a seamless mix of berry, earth and herbal components. The somewhat gritty texture gives it muscle and length, and the overall complexity suggests it can age for up to a quarter century.

US,"This reserve-level cuvée has been made since 2004, but in severely limited amounts. A mix of one-third new, one-third once-used and one-third neutral oak barrels aged the blend. Rich, tight and sappy, it shows generous ripe stone and tropical fruits, along with rich layers of butterscotch and toast.

France,"A very shy closed nose gives little away but the palate reveals all. A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty. Alluring now but absolutely certain to become spectacular with some age. The finish is totally dry, aromatic and long.

France,"A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic. The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins.

France,"Here is an ageworthy wine, a proper grand cru. The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate. But already, the fruit is impressively ripe and jammy, a fruit salad of black and red berry fruits. The tannins are dark, brooding away in the background.

France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert.

France,"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.",Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,95,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2011 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),Alsace white blend,Domaine Marcel Deiss
France,"Hay flowers, honey and ripe yellow pear create an alluring nose. The palate adds even more fruit, with juicy mirabelle and peach carried by boost of residual sugar. This richness is aptly countered by lemon and tangerine zest. This joyful exuberant medium-sweet wine has a tightrope balance and incredibly deep and rich dimensions of fruit. The finish is lasting and pure.

France,"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought.

France,"Utter generosity of both ripe and dried pear is immediately evident on the nose. Notions of sandalwood hover. The dry palate carries that same, generous fluidity at its deep core. There is immense concentration, shimmering with dried, fresh and cooked pear. But there also is a sense of earth, stone and fresh orange peel. The wine seems like a message from another world, , leading you beyond the physical, into a wold of contemplation.

France,"Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed.

France,"A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear.

France,"The nose suggests utter generosity of ripe juicy pear fruit. The palate enforces this with rounded, aromatic and very pure notes of ripe Bartlett pear. The flavors are precisely drawn, framed by incisive freshness that corsets the richness and gives it a beautiful outline. There is barely concealed strength here and great energy. You can feel the warmth of the sun that ripened these lovely grapes. The finish is lasting and dry.

France,"Peach and tangerine unite to create an utterly seductive nose: luscious juicy flesh is defined by aromatic spice and zestiness. These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance. There is something defiant about this dry concentrated wine. Perhaps it is a welcome and encouraging counterweight to so much sadness in the world.",Fronholz,96,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Fronholz Riesling (Alsace),Riesling,Domaine Ostertag
France,"A heady swirl of Amalfi lemon hits you right in the heart, if not the nose. The lemon notes become even more fully expressed on the taut but full, streamlined but expressive and dry body: they take the rich guise of lemon oil and candied peel. They are utterly tart and fresh but with that golden ripeness at their very core that makes this rather seductive. Taste buds just want to get to the bottom of this and rejoice in the purity and fruity tang. This is translucent and refreshing but also rich and full of delicious lemony vigor. The finish is lip-smacking. It will be hard to resist this, but this is certain to get even better. Drink now through 2035.",Heissenberg,95,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Heissenberg Riesling (Alsace),Riesling,Domaine Ostertag
France,"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too.

France,"Considered by many as the finest of the Grand Crus, Les Clos is steep, south-facing and impressive just to look at.

France,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling.

France,"Fermented and aged in six-year old wood for 24 months, this is a richly spicy wine. The wood is there to smell and taste, but it is the rich fruit that speaks.

France,"From a domaine located in Gigondas, this is a profound Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

France,"The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey—lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity.

France,"A heady and lifted nose suggests healing herbs steeped in honey. The palate is rich and unctuous but fresh with the lemon peel, herb and clear honey notes that were already present on the nose. The balance between luscious and tart is on a knife's edge and all the more thrilling for it. The flavors last and last—not in sweetness but in utter, gloried freshness.

France,"The nose is still shy but already tells of tender sweetness. The palate has a rounded earthy smoky element that grounds the luscious generous fruit of dried pear and supersweet Reine Claude and mirabelle plums. The sweetness of this SGN is balanced and almost fresh, but the intriguing thing is a kind of smoky, dark and mysterious core of stone.",Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave,95,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave Pinot Gris (Alsace),Pinot Gris,Domaine Schoffit
France,"Barley sugar, butterscotch, demerara sugar and the faintest hint of maple syrup suggest the richness of this SGN right away. The concentrated sweetness is countered with illuminating freshness and holds tons of tangy spice. Wow. This is incredibly concentrated and has an elixir-like bundled energy that seems to be alive. The effect is both mesmerizing and invigorating.",Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles,96,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Pinot Gris (Alsace),Pinot Gris,Domaine Schoffit
France,"The musky touch of botrytized fruit appears immediately, adding even more allure to the golden color. An explosion of golden apricot and luscious peach provide mouthfilling sweetness on the palate. All this is countered by very concentrated lemon freshness. This is not one of the tooth-achingly sweet SGNs—this is fresher and still has vivid fruit flavors. The finish has so much freshness it is lip-smacking. This will be a killer with fruit-centered desserts. Its sweetness-acid balance is of utter poise and a wonderful class act.

France,"The spicy, evocative scent of Seville orange peel entices from the first sniff. The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment. This is dry but faceted, taut but playful. Irresistible now but with a brilliant, aromatic and totally seductive future ahead.

France,"The nose at first is all about aromatic orange zest but with a little more air there are lovely hints of jasmine and honeysuckle. The palate adds a judicious bitterness and counters this with residual sweetness. The counterpoint here is between texture and full fruit. This is incredibly powerful, as if some inner force was at work. This seems like a genie in a bottle—willful, driven and deliciously aromatic. The finish is off dry and long. Lovely now but sure to last.

France,"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine.

France,"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there.

US,"A very elegant and refined Evenstad Reserve, with grace notes of sandalwood and a lovely cherry core. The fruit is immaculate, the concentration focused and lengthy, and the flavors are so artfully blended that the wine is seamless and perfectly balanced.

US,"This is the winery's top Chardonnay, kept in bottle an extra year prior to release. Even in a challenging vintage such as 2011 it's a huge wine with astonishing concentration and power. The fruit has coiled intensity—so potent that it seems ready to burst wide open. Ripe apple and peach, olive oil, toasted almonds and plenty of new oak flavors abound. It's a jaw-dropper, and may be drunk now through 2022.",Récolte Grand Cru,96,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Domaine Serene 2011 Récolte Grand Cru Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),Chardonnay,Domaine Serene
US,"This is a sensational vintage for this cuvée, which is part of the winery's extensive Chardonnay lineup. It offers intense fruit concentration and retains the opulence for which the winery is known. Rich in a buttered, toasted nut flavor, the mouthfeel is creamy and sensual. The finish lingers for several minutes, and the wine drinks as well or better on the second day it's been open.",Evenstad Reserve,95,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Domaine Serene 2013 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),Chardonnay,Domaine Serene
France,"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last.

France,"This is the third vintage of a wine from a single parcel of ungrafted vines, produced in a walled vineyard within the ruins of the Sancerre city walls. The vines are a selection from the family's Les Romains vineyard. It cannot be labeled Sancerre because of the experimental methods used in its production. The wine is young, needing to age to develop its concentrated fruits and rich apple and apricot flavors. Tight and tense at this stage, it will develop slowly.

France,"From an organic parcel of vines, this floral and honey-flavored wine is superbly rich. The 12 months in wood adds spice and a touch of toast as well as giving the wine a delicious oxidative edge. It is an opulent wine, hinting at honey, with ripe melon and quince flavors.

France,"Laurence Faller is the family winemaker at Domaine Weinbach, and this wine is a tribute to her skills.

France,"This is, quite simply, great Riesling. It has all the subtlety that the grape can produce, as well as a sense of longevity. There's an intensity of fruit—apples and citrus—that cuts through the texture, leaving a beautiful, lingering aftertaste.

France,"Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil.

France,"Subtle notes of earth mix with summer blossom, along with hints of honey, quince and zesty, fresh lemon peel. These aromas dance and take turns on the dry, balanced palate that shines both with rich fruit and slender tone. Lemony freshness pervades everything with its brightness.

France,"A fragrant and pure nose of slightly floral tangerine peel opens this wine. It offers a ripe fruit-driven dance of aromas and freshness—think tangerine, ripe lemon, crisp apple and a beguiling floral dimension. Lovely now in its primary-flavored youth, it's certain to become even more disarming in the future.

France,"Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision.

France,"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.",Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru,95,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Gewürztraminer,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
France,"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond.

France,"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity.

The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate.

They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time.

France,"A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself.

The peachy fruit has a serene easy sweetness that has its perfect counter measure in orange and Meyer lemon freshness. This is poised and sweet but countered and cut by immense freshness. The aromas have yet to unfold fully. Both blood orange and peach lurk promisingly. It is the seamless poised texture of this late harvest that stands out, along with supreme purity. Wait for this.

France,"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age.

France,"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously.

This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean.

France,"A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness.

France,"Funky notions of yeast still cloud the nose. The palate gives us tense, concentrated lemon and tangerine zest at first but you feel that there is more strength, almost raw force, at the core of this that still needs to develop and work out its balance. This is a big wine, energetic and dry, intense and generous but not yet fully fledged. Drinking it now would rob it of its as of yet untapped essence.

The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully.

On the palate the flavors the apple flavor acquires the merest touch of honey while vivid lemon awakes all taste buds. This is intense and incisive but not heavy at all. The palate is dry and poised.

Exquisite tartness tingles deliciously on the tongue and ripples its vivid rays of shimmering bright light across the senses—what a picture of 2014. If you like it emollient and rounded this is not for you. This is for lovers of bright uncompromising purity and freshness. This has real verve, bags of it, all backed up with serious lemon fruit.

US,"Fruit, wonderful fruit flavors drive this rich and ripe wine from the first whiff to the lingering finish. Very little obvious oak intrudes on the vivid strawberry, cherry and black currant notes that are backed by a firm but velvety texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity.

US,"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture.

Germany,"The wonderful minerality imparted by the Doctor vineyard is somehow able to keep this intensely sweet, rich wine from being heavy or cloying. Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout.",Berncasteler Doctor Beerenauslese Goldkap,96,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Dr. H.

Germany,"While sometimes the Pauly-Bergweiler wines come across as too simply sweet, this one hits all the right notes, from an outrageously exotic bouquet of dried apricots, orange marmalade and faintly sweaty socks that add a kinky edge to the rich, layered texture in the mouth and virtually endless finish.

US,"There are excellent savory qualities to this bottling, with white pepper, charred lamb, soy and pine resin adding much intrigue to the black currant fruit. The umami character is strong on the sip, with beef jerky, black pepper and wild mushroom broth flavors, but there is also some tangy fruit as well as upright tannins that will keep this wine singing for years.

Austria,"The sumptuous nose immediately signals that this is a special treat: layers of fresh and dried apple melded into autolytic notes of fresh brioche, challah and almond-crusted pastry. While the flavors of the palate remain equally sumptuous—introducing an almost salty notion of maple syrup—the spine of fresh acidity pulls an ultratight focus, providing all that richness with a firm, soaring frame. Made from 100% Chardonnay, this is an Austrian take on the absolute pedigree of this grape made into vintage-sparkling, zero-dosage Blanc de Blancs.

Austria,"This wines arrives on tiptoe, citrus-scented and fresh, but once it expands on your palate it soon fills the mouth with all manner of stone fruits. As befits this vintage, everything is tempered with grapefruit zestiness but both mirabelle and apricot richness not only lend flavor but also a beautiful texture that insinuates quince and blood orange zest. What a triumph, what a marvel. Irresistible now but with incredible concentration this is built to last.

Austria,"Initially tightly closed on nose, this wine slowly emerges with time in the glass. The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears. There are pleasing shadows of pepper and herbal spice, but what is most convincing is the compact, complete fluidity with which this envelopes the palate.

The palate shows that counterpoint of ripeness and tartness that makes this so very moreish. This is juicy and powerful, yet precise and toned despite all its generosity.

There is the merest touch of blossom honey before the palate opens up into a nirvana of apricot and rounded aromatic orange and mandarin flavors.

Time has tempered the herbal aromatics, giving this rich, ripe effort a subtle subtext of olive and sage.

The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer.

Spain,"Luscious prune and blackberry aromas come with complex notes of graphite, toast and tobacco. The palate on this 80-case, high-end Tinto Fino is about as full as they come while still maintaining impeccable balance. Roasted berry, cassis and salty leather flavors are delicious but also challenging, while baked berry flavors, raw power and ripe tannins define the finish.

This Tinto Fino delivers a huge wave of mocha, blackberry, tobacco and coffee aromas in front of a dense and layered palate that's packed with prune, chocolate, cassis and blackberry flavors.

Austria,"Lusciously ripe, almost honeyed, pear fruit emanates from the glass. Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless.

Austria,"Hints of moss, yeast and freshly zested orange peel edged with pine honey initially suggest a dry wine. It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear—again in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise. Glints of vanilla pod, candied peel and white pepper open up, vista after vista.

Underneath that, tightly curled freshness suggests both candied lemon slices and lemon sorbet—but this needs time to unfurl its glory.

Austria,"The finely tuned sweetness of this Auslese brings out the muskier notes of apple: a mix of fresh and baked fruit, with peeled skin and compote flesh. Initially, there still is the spectre of yeast but with some time there are hints of burnt sugar and apricot compote, too. A lovely, engulfing apple tartness makes this as suited to baked fruit desserts and fruit tarts as to creamy, ripe cheeses. Full marks for poise and freshness. This is a baby still and will need time to come into its own and unfold even more layers.

Austria,"The nose is still dominated by funky yeast, signaling that this Riesling requires time in bottle. The streamlined palate reveals something that is equally generous and tart, like pink grapefruit or pomelo. There is a lovely phenolic texture, too, with intimations of riper fruit in the background that will still take their time to appear. Best to let this slumber for a while in a cool cellar.

Austria,"Yeasty funk initially plays over a whole mix of pink grapefruit, mandarin and lemon flavors. The citrus party continues on the palate, with zesty notes of citrus peel. Verve and freshness are kept only in slight check by a phenolic backbone and are driven on by the linear lemon freshness. While totally compelling now, the wine will become even more intriguing with bottle age. Drink 2015–2020.",Ried Schütt Smaragd,95,Wachau,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Emmerich Knoll 2013 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,Emmerich Knoll
Austria,"Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way.

Austria,"Fresh pear and lively yeast, peppery watercress and fresh citrus create a lively, appetizing nose. The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core. This is still very young but so ready and utterly irresistible, yet with the mileage to age.

This is suave and slender, with a very light but deceptive touch: apple and stone fruit, now wound tightly in citrus lie in wait, ready to burst forth when their moment comes.

There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness. This is very young now and will show its true but thrilling citrus-tinted colors with some bottle age.

Austria,"An overtone of leesy yeast quickly gives way to lemony freshness, rounded out by hints of yellow plum and peach. Citrus also continues to be the focus on the palate: fresh zest of ripe lemons and Meyer lemons just edged by peppery spice. This is taut and very linear, streamlined, concentrated and slender but still tightly wound. This will relax into more spice and fruit with a little while in bottle.

Austria,"Once the first whiff of yeast has worn off, a very pure, linear procession of citrus flavors presents itself: from the yellowish green of grapefruit to the greenish orange of a tangy tangerine, always with a deeper, more resonant core of earth and stone. The zestiness glistens on the surface, the tightly closed, still earthy fruit broods at the core. Wait for it to explode.

Austria,"The extreme eastern vineyard of the Wachau is a stony valley, giving an extreme wine, all mineral and cool, poised fruit even in a warm year like 2006. Yes, there are pears and currant fruit flavors, but the wine goes more towards the lime and salt, to fit with its austere structure. Age for at least 10 years.",Loibner Steinertal Smaragd,95,Wachau,Roger Voss,@vossroger,F X Pichler 2006 Loibner Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,F X Pichler
Austria,"This is always a major wine, and this vintage is no exception. It is spectacularly ripe, spicy, concentrated and fruity. The yellow fruits, tangy citrus and mineral structure all contribute to an intense complexity.

Austria,"This is an impressively rich, ripe wine that maintains great swathes of fresh pear and apple flavors. It is dense on the palate, with a powerful mineral and steel expression to pair with the opulent texture and rounded aftertaste. Should develop well over at least five years.",Loibner Oberhauser Smaragd,95,Wachau,Roger Voss,@vossroger,F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Oberhauser Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,F X Pichler
Austria,This is a rich and complex wine that shows spiced pear and a tense structure. It is very aromatic and fresh while also rich and concentrated. A powerful statement of the fruit and minerality of the Wachau and definitely for long-term aging.

Austria,"Luscious notes of ripe stone fruit have tropical overtones of pineapple, with some musky notes on both the nose and palate. The ripeness of the pineapple is even more accented in the mouth where it contrasts with totally crisp lime acidity. This is exciting now but has the backbone to age beautifully through 2025 at least.",Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd,95,Wachau,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,F X Pichler 2013 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,F X Pichler
Austria,"A delightful citrus scent intrigues, suggesting yuzu or mandarin. The palate is richer and introduces notions of earth and that pithy, phenolic edge of serious Grüner Veltliner. The initial citrus on the nose returns with redoubled force on the streamlined, fresh and still tightly closed palate. Give this time to unwind, so that the fruit can fully express itself. The deliciously green- and orange-tinged finish promises everything.

Austria,"Musky, heady notes of ripeness move within the pear scent of this serious Federspiel. Their richness is countered by grapefruit peel that gives verve and nerve to the entire wine, corsetting its ripeness with delicious citric acidity. There is a phenolic dimension, too, but that fizzling citrus freshness is just so much fun. This will stay fresh and exciting for a long time.

Austria,"Slender poise and supercharged lemon are signaled with the first sniff. A pleasantly bitter note—think almond or Castelfranco—plays along the edges of the palate before riper, more generous yellow plum kicks in, always toned by that citrus freshness.

Austria,"Wonderfully ripe flavors of juicy, yellow pear precede everything. With a little air, the palate gives us the full ultraspicy force of true Grüner: a real hit of freshly ground white pepper, leesy yeast notes and herbal tinges of chervil, arugula and watercress, all bound up in a smooth, concentrated but compact package with lasting, savory length and a seam of freshness.",Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd,95,Wachau,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Grüner Veltliner,F X Pichler
Austria,"A barely-there glimpse of lemon bids you to step closer and take a sip. The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to.

Austria,"Perfumed peach is edged with citrus, yeast and a hint of pepper on a very enticing nose. The palate tinges the fruit with far more savoriness: the full force of yeasty spice, something herbal and salty and incredibly moreish. Citrus also provides a wonderfully high-toned dimension that suggests pink grapefruit zest and kumquats.

Austria,"The nose is a tease of subtle mandarin and lemon zest, promising but not giving away very much at all. The alluring juiciness of the palate hints at small, yellow mirabelle plums but as of yet merely plays at the surface. Underneath it all is a solid powerhouse bursting with Seville orange, freshness and precision. Another one to keep, guard and treasure for a precious but enlightening soirée.

Austria,"Bergamot and lemon, grapefruit and tangerine: students of citriculture would find much to explore—perfumers too. As a drinker you just want to dive into this inviting, fragrant pool of refreshment. There is a powdery edge too, and quite some texture, despite the most slender of bodies. This represents depth rather than power and is a ticket straight to a citrussy Riesling heaven.

Austria,"Savory hints of moss and lime, of fragrant, crushed citrus foliage and very pure lemon zest make for a totally seductive nose. How this can have all the fragrant promise of the coast when it is from landlocked Austria is anyone's guess. The palate is concentrated, streamlined and presents a panoply of zesty citrus notes: mandarin and lemon peel one moment, lime and grapefruit the next.

US,"An intensity of petrol-like oakiness on the nose of this wine suggests a youthful coiling that's yet to unravel. Still, plenty of promise is revealed, from robust yet floral elements of golden apple and honey to the effusive back notes of peach.

US,"This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling. The tannins and oak are lightly imprinted around strawberry-rhubarb and fresh-cut rose, and the texture seductively silky. This is a delicious treat of a wine that should also age.",Russian River Selection,95,California,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Gary Farrell 2013 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
US,"Made from one of the vineyard's historic blocks, this is a lush, inviting and complex wine, defined by golden honey apple and nutmeg.

Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity.

The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it.

The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates.

Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying.

Cherry vanilla, leathery cedar and juicy plum combine around a lush, voluptuous mouthfeel of tension and tannin. Incredibly satisfying, it shows a length of spicy clove on the finish that appears to go on for days.

The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish.

Austria,"On the nose, a blast of beeswax and honey provides heady lift. The palate is tooth-breakingly sweet but comes with that honeyed, candied-citrus thrill. Sufficient bright acidity counters all the richness. The mouthfeel is full, oily and viscous, always with that honeycomb and beeswax note, not quite tipping into the savoriness of maple syrup.

Australia,"From vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine. Menthol and vanilla notes frame black cherries and cassis on the nose, while the palate reveals supple tannins and meaty, savory complexities. The finish is softly dusty, fine and long.

The palate is generous but dry, showing off the pristine pear fruit and wonderful phenolic texture that gives as much structure to this wine as its fine pure lemony acidity.

The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last.

This Pinot takes time to show the glorious red cherry that is there in abundance, caressed by gentle, smoky oak. This will take time to blossom but will reward patience.

There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest.

France,"Interestingly released after the softer 2009 version of this wine, this 2008 vintage is beautifully balanced between crisp fruit and ripe maturity.

Austria,"A touch of flint on fleshy peach is followed by juicy citrus and ripe pear bedded in nettle and watercress. Together they present an immensely enticing nose, hinting at whole oceans of luscious fruit beneath the surface.

On the exquisitely dry palate, it is the vivid, bright and intense lemon freshness that takes over, but those earthier notes still flash up around the edges, adding interest and depth.

It has a rich golden color, slightly earthy aromas, plus bread dough and white-peach scents that lead to very opulent, sophisticated and nicely aged flavors that range from toasted walnut to honeyed peach to white pepper.

Schram Sparkling (North Coast),Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
US,"Made from 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, spice-tinged fruit aromas and toasted baguette complexity make a grand entrance on the nose. It then gushes bold and complex flavors, like toasted walnuts and almonds, poached pears and a touch of ginger.

US,"This is a beautiful, complex and complete wine, from the delicate, spiced raspberry aroma through the creamy, nuanced finish. Subtle but well-defined fruit flavors like white cherry and raspberry pulse across the palate, buoyed by an ultrafine effervescence and lively acidity.

The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit.

Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential.

France,"A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages.

France,"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to.

On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow.

Juicy in fresh cherry, it combines structured elegance and plenty of power, amid a mouthwatering quality that's seductively delicious and yet just begs the question of how much more nuanced the flavors will be in time.

Wild strawberry, Bing cherry and black tea stand out, with an undercurrent of lushness that's hard to resist.",Allen Vineyard,96,California,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Williams Selyem 2013 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Woody, herbal and resplendent in forest-floor pine and sandalwood, this is a complex, earthy and medium-bodied wine. It's low in oak, and revelatory in cool-climate seductions of pomegranate, cranberry and rhubarb compote. The finish is all black tea, with still-developing tannin structure and power.",Calegari Vineyard,95,California,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Williams Selyem 2013 Calegari Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"There is something ethereal and beyond words about this wine, a full-bodied but never intrusive expression of spicy cinnamon, black pepper and wild pine that makes it a puzzle worth trying to solve. Fruit plays a part, though softly, eking out shadows of raspberry and just-picked strawberry atop smooth, silky tannins and a measured, seductive body. The finish recalls a clove cigarette enjoyed in the rain.",Coastlands Vineyard,98,California,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Williams Selyem 2013 Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Silky, with pronounced tannins that should mellow in time, this is an earthy, stemmy and perfumed wine.

US,"Expressive in oak, earth and clove with cinnamon-cola, this savory, complex wine is also impressive in its ability to offer crisp and focused lines of citrus and fresh-picked raspberry. It teeter-totters the variety's ability to be both fruit-forward and elusively hard to reach. Streaks of thyme and rosemary figure into the mix.

Portugal,"From a great vintage in the Douro, this is a dark, closed, brooding wine. It has the richest texture, full of dark layers of black plums, chocolate, leather and followed by concentrated acidity.

Portugal,"The original vineyard owned by winemaking husband and wife Jorge Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva, this is halfway up the Pinhão Valley, close to some of the greatest Douro vineyards. Pintas is now well established as a Douro classic. It is powered by tannins at this stage, but the structure, the lush fruit that comes from fermentation in open lagars and the sheer density of the wine, speak of greatness.

France,"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins.
